This is an exercise from the *Getting and Cleaning Data* course of coursera, to understand it better go to the **codebook**, where I explain where the data comes from and how to get it. Also what does each file mean.\
Basically what I did was transform from raw data to tidydata, following these steps:
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
* Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
